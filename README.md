# City Explorer API

**Author**: Ethan Luxton
**Version**: 1.4.0

## Overview
This is a express server intended to handle requests for API data from my front-end react app. It handles requests for both weather and movie data for locations inputted by the user and is hosted on Heroku.

## Getting Started
Clone down this repo using:
```
git clone https://github.com/ethan-luxton/city-explorer-api.git
```

Then in your newly cloned repository use:
```
npm start
```

This should start the server on port 3001 on localhost. NOTE: You must have the frontend and backend running on the same time. The front end will be on port 3000 and the backend will be on port 3001.
